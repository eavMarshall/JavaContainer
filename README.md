# JavaContainer
## _A super simple dependency injection container for java_

This is a test to get a dependency injection container for java 8

## Current feature set
- Immutable
- Container will always inject itself, rather than create a new container
- Overridable configuration for testing
  -- each override will return a new immutable container
